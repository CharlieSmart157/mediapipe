Forked from MediaPipe: https://github.com/googlesamples/mediapipe/tree/main/examples/pose_landmarker/android

This is a tech test for Magic.

I have implemented logic for recording and recognizing poses via MediaPipe. 

The user can record a base pose, then a right and left pose. The app will then keep count of reps for both exercises seperately.

Please go to here for my specific changes: https://github.com/CharlieSmart157/mediapipe/tree/main/examples/pose_landmarker/android/app/src/main/java/com/google/mediapipe/examples/poselandmarker

MainViewModel.kt houses the logic for recording and detecting poses.
